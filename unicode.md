title: Unicode
---

Non-breaking additions to support full Unicode, including new Unicode literal form in strings and new RegExp `u` mode to handle code points, as well as new APIs to process strings at the 21bit code points level.  These additions support building global apps in JavaScript.

```JavaScript
// same as ES5.1
"𠮷".length == 2

// new RegExp behaviour, opt-in ‘u’
"𠮷".match(/./u)[0].length == 2

// new form
"\u{20BB7}"=="𠮷"=="\uD842\uDFB7"

// new String ops
"𠮷".codePointAt(0) == 0x20BB7

// for-of iterates code points
for(var c of "𠮷") {
  console.log(c);
}
```
