title: Enhanced Object Literals
---

Object literals are extended to support setting the prototype at construction, shorthand for `foo: foo` assignments, defining methods, making super calls, and computing property names with expressions.  Together, these also bring object literals and class declarations closer together, and let object-based design benefit from some of the same conveniences.

```JavaScript
var obj = {
    // __proto__
    __proto__: theProtoObj,
    // Shorthand for ‘handler: handler’
    handler,
    // Methods
    toString() {
     // Super calls
     return "d " + super.toString();
    },
    // Computed (dynamic) property names
    [ 'prop_' + (() => 42)() ]: 42
};
```
